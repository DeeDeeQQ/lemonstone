Using React and any frameworks/open source libraries required (MobX is prefered), create an application that does the
following: Periodically (every 10 seconds) poll for new posts from this API
https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=story via a GET request.
Display the title, url, created_at, and author of each post in a table.
Upon selecting a row in the table, a modal should appear containing the raw JSON data of post. This
modal should support dismissal by clicking outside of the modal as well as upon clicking a close button.
Support the ability to filter/search the table by title. You can submit your assignment by uploading the
zip file or use Github.
